Description: Gene information from 'Ensembl' genome builds 'GRCh38.p14' and 'GRCh37.p13' to use with the 'topr' package. The datasets were originally downloaded from <https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.111.gtf.gz> and <https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/grch37/current/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.87.gtf.gz> and converted into the format required by the 'topr' package. See <https://github.com/totajuliusd/topr?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-topr-with-other-species-than-human> to see the required format.
